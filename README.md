# cuschess
a chess game written by a dumbass. Here is a [footage](https://gfycat.com/lonelylegalinchworm) of me playing around with it

### How to install and play

#### For linux
clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/atif5/cuschess`

install the requirements with pip:

`pip install -r cuschess/requirements.txt`

after you are done simply execute:

`python3 -m cuschess`

#### For windows
again, clone this repo (git cmd recommended):

`git clone https://github.com/atif5/cuschess`

install the requirements with pip:

`py -m pip install -r cuschess/requirements.txt`

then:

`py -m cuschess`

### Notes

- This project is still under progress and the online option is not functional, you can easily alter the code and play on LAN though.
- There is NO sound.
- Cus is just a stupid word in turkish that I make fun of. Decided to name my project after it for shits and giggles :D
